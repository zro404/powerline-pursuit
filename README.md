# Powerline Pursuit
## Made for Godot Wild Jam #73
In Powerline Pursuit, you find yourself behind the wheel, navigating a vast desert with one crucial mission: to repair a network of electric towers scattered across the ever-shifting sands. As the sole technician in a remote environment, you'll drive your vehicle across a procedurally generated desert landscape, where no two runs are the same.
